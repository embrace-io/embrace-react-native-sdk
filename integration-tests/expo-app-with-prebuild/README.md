Generated by:
* copying `../basic-test-app`
* running `npx expo prebuild --clean` to clear the native code changes
* adding the `android` and `ios` folders to .gitignore

Our Expo config plugin can then be tested by running `./test-plugin.sh`and verifying the generated `android` and `ios`
folders.

See [this guide](../integration-tests/README.md) for more instructions on how to setup and run this app.
